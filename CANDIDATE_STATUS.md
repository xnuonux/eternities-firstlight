# A Table After the Rain — development candidate

The normal `index.html`, `FIRSTLIGHT_VALLEY.html`, `build.py`, launcher and trusted save origin remain the reviewed PR19 build. This branch's gathering extension is **not yet a whole-game-qualified release**.

Read [component results and integration gate](docs/development/GATHERING_COMPONENT_RESULTS_2026-09-24.md). The continuation repaired contextual priority, stale arrangement confirmations and asynchronous audio cancellation. Its 48 Node component tests and 31 browser-component assertions passed locally; these do not replace the existing full-game suites.

To work on the isolated candidate in a full checkout, first inspect `tools/build_table_candidate.py`. It reconstructs and hashes the exact reviewed base, then writes a separate output. Do not replace the trusted entrypoints, import a candidate schema10 save into an older client, reset personal data or reuse an archive as a newer gameplay checkout.

The next required milestone is the real app integration and persistence pass, followed by both-camera rendered play. The offline music listening sheet distributed with the change package is only a listening study. There was no merge, deployment or live Luna connection.
