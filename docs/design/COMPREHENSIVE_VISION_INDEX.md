# Firstlight: the recovered vision and the next playable gates

Retrieved and reconciled 2026-09-15; bounded GitHub/Drive/Downloads refresh 2026-09-20. The latest refresh found no newer relevant game-canon upload; newer broad Eternities hub files concerned other projects. See the [intake and adaptation contract](../development/MARKS_BENEATH_THE_RAIN_TASK_2026-09-20.md). Dom asked to use Astra's new visions and specifically confirmed Earth, Heaven, Hell and Atlantis. These files are design sources, not additional authority to execute archived scripts, import old gameplay or settle open founder decisions.

## Where the complete material lives

[PR #14](https://github.com/xnuonux/eternities-firstlight/pull/14), archive branch `archive/recovered-canon-drive-backup-2026-09-14` at `799a0a467dd11b50742c3b441c45e807e4454443`, publishes the recovered canon, conversations and Drive inventory. It is separate from the gameplay baseline, [PR #13](https://github.com/xnuonux/eternities-firstlight/pull/13) at `bdad75b70b7762f6ef89fe0982ebc07cd4ddef0c`. Later implementation belongs on the current gameplay tree.

The [complete Drive archive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Mgw2enpflnqyYreLF-AJy71msndTItnJ) contains the [original canon packages](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RrlQdw-aAgIuo2yAfdfialDSJ3M9k5y3), [readable masters](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1d8Y2MeOnx-3u9rNfbuq6hMWo_qSjYzwv) and [verification receipts](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1K-5jA-PDMKWNlGjnlYDeMoqrbVszLKL9). The [Cosmos package](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bSLVJ5FG6GHHESRkSjzF9F9Ryi1RymH1) is a subsequent addition.

All five realm ZIPs were downloaded in full. Earth, Heaven, Hell and Atlantis match the original archive manifest; Cosmos matches its published package receipt. The expanded design library was also downloaded and hashed locally, but its outer ZIP is not listed in the originals manifest. No claim of independent outer-hash verification is made for that library. Member manifests for Earth, Hell and Atlantis were checked after safe extraction. No archive scripts were executed.

| Package | Bytes | SHA-256 |
|---|---:|---|
| Cosmos | 5,940,418 | `c39b211390875dd166392eb3c136a37dc38dfc7727cc8eff2cd815e9555427e2` |

A compact machine receipt is [REALM_PACKAGE_RECEIPT.json](REALM_PACKAGE_RECEIPT.json). Local preserved packages and intake notes are under `C:/dev/firstlight-artifacts/cosmos-2026-09-15/design/`; the remote archive above is the portable retrieval path. Large ZIPs and recovered conversations are kept out of the gameplay source diff.

## Astra's direction by realm

All five full packages were retrieved. Assigned intake colleagues read the Earth, Heaven, Hell and Atlantis readers, and the implementation owner read their next-task handoffs. For Cosmos M1, the M0/M1 handoff, prototype specification, source review and relevant art/coordinate guidance were read. The synthesis, concordance and Firstlight bridge were also inspected. This table condenses their distinct first gates; it does not mean all five realms have been built.

| Realm and complete reader | Identity | First bounded playable gate | Current status |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Earth](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hI0FVO3TVa34waL7VpGMSOjUpiNsQFcz/view) | The inhabited home: workshop, equipment, gardens, companion, music and ordinary consequences | E0/E1: inventory scene ownership, then connect Oren, the riverbank, lake/orchard and Bellweather approaches with measured rigid transforms and real ground. Preserve local combat coordinates. No payout in the geography gate. | E1 connected approach/riverbank and E2 Road After Rain are implemented in PRs #17–18. The current field-note branch adds the optional post-delivery Mara clue. Settlement expansion, gathering and full Earth campaign remain later gates. |
| [Heaven](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B1LnZIGR8vaLgAOeVXBjRFmHievca3Vv/view) | Genuine welcome, communion and cultivated radiance, with bone white, gold, ruby and dawn | H0/H1: recover and qualify the original Heaven prototype source, preserve its trial/relic/save contract, then refine its visual language in its separately owned lane. Later, a connected Broken Choir garden expedition. | Design and old reference prototype retrieved. No Heaven runtime merge or source replacement. |
| [Hell](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NmrYkHG69VIfLt0oVKRHUGR4ChQ9RfZ6/view) | Captured light, coercion and dangerous industry, with real refuge and recoverable choices | D0/D1: trusted rules adapter and isolated fixture; an inhabited Kiln Refuge, two approaches toward Bell Yard, real cover, readable lighting and a grounded way home. Later, the complete rescue/return expedition and separate equipment contracts. | Design intake complete; no Hell runtime added. |
| [Atlantis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ghHVZ_kM_OQ-6gW9LS2OFfeP4jNcE6wD/view) | A continuing maritime civilization: surface islands, submerged streets, dry air courts and civic life | A0: dry pier to surface entry, bounded underwater corridor, dry air court and return. Character/camera medium are separate; explicit depth controls, stable horizon and real dry volumes come first. No combat/payout or surprise drowning timer in this gate. | Design intake complete. Existing Earth walking does not imply swimming. The founder's final name/scope remains open. |
| [Cosmos](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H1vq86q1pZ_boP8YKMeiH3o7hEII2wnb/view) | An extraordinary sky above a place people actually inhabit | M0/M1: connected Near Expanse, Three Lamps, refuge, two ground approaches, raised occupied observatory, camera parity and safe return under one stable up vector. | Implemented by the current branch. [Task boundary](../development/COSMOS_M1_TASK_2026-09-15.md); [fresh results](../development/COSMOS_M1_RESULTS_2026-09-15.md). Later encounters, contracts and fittings remain pending. |

## The common spine

The recovered [Dawn of Eternity synthesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D68Cqv-M2S9cMr4wRRiheNBq0ebWdk4l/view), `EDITORIAL_CONCORDANCE.md` and `FIRSTLIGHT_MYTHOLOGY_BRIDGE.md` preserve a mainline chronology alongside explicitly alternate material. The Creator and First Light remain uncreated. The Regent's final saga confrontation remains on Earth; the Answering is not silently completed by a prototype visit.

Earth remains the home anchor. Its Beacons stabilize Roads of Light. Hell can corrupt, occupy or sever those roads; a local repair does not settle everyone's morality. A player's home can later accumulate material traces of other cultures, professions and journeys. That does not require a cosmic revelation in every starter quest or a new grief event for Briar.

Share proven navigation, camera, cover and transition primitives where there is an actual second caller. Keep realm definitions, quest/run IDs, rewards and story facts separate. A Cosmos invitation does not advance Earth, assign a class or grant an allegiance. An Atlantis surface hint does not enable diving. Protected sanctuary and resident material stays outside game entities.

## Decisions still open

Paid power, offline-loss severity, rare-pet allocation, construction scale, province/realm names and scale, final native engine choice, respec policy and real multiplayer authority remain unresolved. The recovered packages propose options; this branch does not settle them. No live Luna integration, fake participants, proprietary asset extraction or public deployment is implied.

The next acceptance is human: walk the new road with a fresh and returning character in both cameras. The connected Earth approach, delivery and optional Mara investigation now reuse those contracts. Further settlement work must preserve the existing equipment outing and its once-only versus repeat rewards. Full Heaven, Hell and Atlantis content should keep their own bounded implementation gates.
